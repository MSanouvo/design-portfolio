            <p id="summary-description">I was tasked with conducting a majority
              of the research for the team throughout the project.
              I provided research on the environment and weather conditions
              surrounding the school as well as various solutions that could be
              applied to similar scenarios. As well as providing research,
              I assisted in brainstorming ideas as well as creating designs for
              the prototype. As we grew closer towards our end design, I looked
              for inexpensive and sustainable materials that could be used for
              the final product.​​​​​​​</p>

              <p class="project-content">While working with UCSD's Global TIES
                foundation in one of my classes, I practiced designing in a
                team-based environment throughout a 10 week period. For my final
                project, I worked with the GodFred's foundation and helped prevent
                a school in Ghana from having rain leak into their class spaces.
                In the course of about 8 weeks, I was assigned to a small team of
                4 and worked through brainstorming, iterating, and prototyping a
                product with sustainability in mind.</p>

              <h3 class="project-step">Project Detail</h3>
              <p class="project-content">The GodFreds Foundation is a non-profit
                 organization that aims to build low-budget private schools for
                 underprivileged kids to provide positive learning environments in
                 Ghana. Working with the GodFreds Foundation, my team was assigned
                 to design a solution to stop rainfall that continually entered
                 the classrooms of the school building during stormy seasons.
                 During these seasons, water leaked through the wood panel windows
                 and flood open spaces used by the children in other parts of the
                 school. Designing a solution would help maintain the learning
                 environment of the children who already face many hardships
                 outside of school.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Since the GodFreds Foundation was a non-profit organization, we
                 had to be conscious of the cost that our solution would present.
                 As we were planning out our potential design solutions, we wanted
                 to make sure they could be built out of cost-efficient,
                 sustainable resources.</p>

              <h3 class="project-step">Concepts/Brainstorming</h3>
              <p class="project-content">
                The first step in my brainstorming process was looking at
                existing options to the the problem at hand. Researching ways to
                protect groups of people from rainfall, my team and I created
                pros and cons list for preexisting solutions - this varied from
                simple options such as tents to larger solutions like hurricane
                shutters.
                <br>
                <br>
                Using the knowledge from the list of existing solutions, I
                started to brainstorm possible concepts that could be applied
                to the problem. I was interested in the idea of creating a mini
                storm shutter attachment to place over the window, but upon
                further discussion with the team, we thought that it would've
                been difficult to find suitable materials and install. Other
                notable concepts while collaborating with my team included a
                deployable tarp with different applications.
                <br>
                <br>
                After comparing all the notable ideas using a design matrix,
                we as a whole decided that a drop-down deployable tarp was the
                best concept to implement in response to our problem scenario.

              <h3 class="project-step">Analysis and Testing</h3>
              <p class="project-content">
                After having decided on our concept going forward, my team began
                working on analyzing the design and testing its effectiveness.
                In order to do this, things we considered were how well does our
                design work at blocking out rain and is it a sustainable design
                that would survive a long time in the climate surrounding the
                area.
                <br>
                <br>
                My task was analyzing the cost of the materials we could use. I
                researched various materials that our client could be used to
                build the final product. While researching, I focused on the
                cost of the materials as well as their quality, making sure we
                would be able to send a detailed list of cheap, yet sustainable
                materials so our design would last the school for many years.
                <br>
                <br>
                While I was doing research on materials, the rest of my group
                built a miniature prototype to test out the feasibility of our
                design. Due to our lack of resources and engineering skills,
                they made the prototype with only cardboard and plastic wrap,
                using the materials to act as the school and the tarp. Spraying
                water over the prototype to simulate rainfall, we concluded that
                the design was feasible enough to move forward.

              <h3 class="project-step">Design and Implementation</h3>
              <p class="project-content">With the constraints we faced during
                the course of the project, the team decided to focus on one area
                of the school that seemed to be affected by the rain the most
                based on information shared by the client. Between the impact
                from the rain leaking into the windows and falling into the open
                courtyard, we agreed that addressing the courtyard situation was
                more important.
                <br>
                <br>
                Following our feasibility test using the cardboard mock up and
                the research done during the previous stage of our project, we
                proceeded to compile a list of materials for our client to use
                as they implemented the final product on their end. Our
                deliverables included an outline specifying the design as well
                as a list of materials to order including their cost and
                manufacturer. The issue we addressed in our solution was the
                courtyard which saw rain flooding in it during stormy seasons.
                In order to prevent the courtyard from flooding, we designed a
                cheap, yet sustainable awning tarp that could easily be installed
                over the opening of the courtyard to shield the inside from the
                rainfall.
                <br>
                <br>
                Our implementation process involved passing on our current work
                and findings onto our partner organization to gain their approval.
                From there, they would oversee the rest of the project while we
                would offer support to their implementation. Being a non-profit
                organization, we helped our partners figure out way to receive
                donations and funding as they did when originally building the
                school while keeping their donors engaged throughout the
                implementation process with updates and social media coverage.
                Overall we worked on their desires to the best of our ability to
                offer them the best product we could design for their situation.

              <p class="project-content">
                Due to lack of time, resources, and manpower, we were tasked to
                hand off the final design details to our client as the class came
                to an end so they could continue to implement our final product
                onto their school. There was still a lot that could've been done
                for our product and its design, but our time in the program was
                coming to an end and we had to wrap up the existing work we had
                already made progress on.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking back at the project, there were definitely many hurdles
                we had to jump just to get started. Some of these obstacles
                included lack of communication with our partner in the initial
                stages of the project alongside insufficient information due to
                the preceding problem. Our team went ahead and made educated
                decisions on how to proceed. We looked up relevant information
                and made our decisions based off of what we thought would be
                best for the school - trying to empathize their needs. These
                problems left me to believe that the first few weeks of the
                project were put to waste as I personally was unsure of the
                direction of our design and whether we were making the right
                product that our stakeholders had in mind.
